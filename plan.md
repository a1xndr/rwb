 - process links to open XDG Default browser on click
 - handle Keyboard shortcuts to open webpages and run software
 - make a page that doesn't blow

maybe:
 - audio visualization if its reasonably simple with alsamixer and doesnt murder perf
 - allow populating css fields with settings from .Xdefaults via macros
